THINGS TO DO:

November 22

- COMPLETED: Check zero_one() to make sure it stores BOTH levels of a categorical variable even when `one=` is not being used.

- COMPLETED: Add plot labeling function to avoid needing to use either ggformula or the + pipe with ggplot2

- COMPLETED: Add label_zero_one() automatically to pointplot() when response is zero_one()

November 27

- Replace remaining calls to ggformula.

- clone ntiles() from mosaic to avoid dependency

- Arrange for automatic loading of `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}`.
