THINGS TO DO:

November 22

- COMPLETED: Check zero_one() to make sure it stores BOTH levels of a categorical variable even when `one=` is not being used.

- COMPLETED: Add plot labeling function to avoid needing to use either ggformula or the + pipe with ggplot2

- COMPLETED: Add label_zero_one() automatically to pointplot() when response is zero_one()

November 27

- COMPLETED: Replace remaining calls to ggformula.

- COMPLETED: clone ntiles() from mosaic to avoid dependency

- Arrange for automatic loading of `{ggplot2}` and `{dplyr}`.

December 1

- Add a "signif" option to conf_intervals() that will round to the correct number of digits for each coefficient.

- Extend `model_plot()` to accept a one-sided formula to set the aesthetics
