\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame to use as training data}

\item{tilde}{Formula for the model}

\item{verbose}{whether to report on decisions being made}

\description{
An interface to several of the most often used model-fitting routines
designed to make it easy to construct.
}
\details{
Since data may be piped into this function, the training data
frame will be called simply "data", the name of the first argument to this
function. In order to be able to access the training data in such cases, the
training data is assigned to an attribute of the resulting model, "training_data".
