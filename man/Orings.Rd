\description{
On January 27, 1986, the night before the space shuttle
\emph{Challenger} exploded, an engineer recommended to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that the shuttle not be
launched in the cold weather.  The forecasted temperature for the
\emph{Challenger} launch was 31 degrees Fahrenheit---the coldest
launch ever.  After an intense 3-hour telephone conference, officials
decided to proceed with the launch.  This data frame contains the
launch temperatures and the number of O-ring problems in 24 shuttle
launches prior to the \emph{Challenger}. (This documentation comes from the \code{Sleuth3} package,
where the dataset is called \code{ex2223}.)
