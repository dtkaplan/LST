    <p>For simplicity, only the mother's and father's ratings for the student are given.
The variable name indicates whose rating and on what scale, e.g. <code>m_extra</code> is the
mothers rating on the extraversion scale. Other variables are:</p><ul><li><p>subjid: Unique ID for the student</p></li>
<li><p>age: The student's age when the ratings were collected</p></li>
<li><p>GPA: The student's eventual 4-year grade-point average</p></li>
<li><p>sex: The student's sex</p></li>
<li><p>field: What field the student ended up studying</p></li>
