Description: 'Lessons in Statistical Thinking' (LST) is a textbook for a first or
    second course in statistics that embraces data wrangling, causal
    reasoning, statistical adjustment, and simulation. It minimizes the 
    role of p-values. 'LSTbook' supports a tidy- and pipeline-oriented 
    computing style used in the book. Modeling and data/model graphics 
    are made particularly simple, to provide a gentle learning curve.
